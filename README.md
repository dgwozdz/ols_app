This is the code for an app which:
1) builds an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model,
2) checks the statistical properties of a model,
3) visualizes:
  a) the histogram of errors,
  b) the observed vs. predicted values,
  c) the predicted and observed values vs time (if a target variable is a time series).

The app is available here: https://dgwozdz.shinyapps.io/ols_app/
